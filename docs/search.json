    "text": "Hello! I’m Flavio, a data analytics professional with a background in engineering and a master’s degree in Innovation and Management in Agribusiness. My interest in data analytics emerged while working at Unilever, where I supported the optimization of production processes, contributing to a reduction in packaging material waste and savings of approximately £600k.\nI later joined The Information Lab, where I further developed my expertise in Tableau and Alteryx, delivering data-driven solutions across finance, marketing, and operations. My work has included automating financial reporting, building ETL pipelines for marketing campaign analysis, and improving dashboard performance. I have particular experience translating SQL logic into Alteryx workflows, integrating APIs, parsing XML using regex, and designing efficient, scalable analytics solutions.\nAlongside my consulting work, I have trained over 200 professionals in data analytics tools such as Tableau, Power BI, and Alteryx. I have also expanded my skill set into cloud computing (Azure, AWS, and GCP) and applied machine learning regression techniques in agribusiness-focused projects.\nI am an active member of the data community and have been recognized as a Tableau Community Highlight, earned a Viz of the Day award, and presented at Tableau User Groups in New York, London, Portugal, and Brazil. My writing has been featured on Tableau’s platforms, and I was nominated for four awards at Tableau Conference 2024 in San Diego. In addition, I contribute to pro bono data visualization projects with NGOs worldwide, including work showcased at the United Nations Summit in New York City.\n\nCertifications"
